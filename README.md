## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
1. How might we enhance the flight experience by minimizing queue times for services like customer support, especially during disruptions?

2. How can we educate and entertain passengers both during the flight and during delays or layovers?



## Project Description 🤯
1. An app designed to enhance the airport experience: reducing customer service wait times, educating on flight safety, and entertaining passengers, especially during critical moments.

2. A virtual queue system to reduce standing in queues, enabling passengers to use their time productively, rest, or manage other tasks.

3. An educational game on flight safety measures, offering an entertaining and informative experience suitable for all, including children.

4. A virtual tour or map providing street views of destinations, allowing visitors to explore places virtually before their actual visit.



## Project Value 💰

1. The virtual queuing app promises enhanced customer satisfaction, reducing stress during flight disruptions and fostering loyalty and positive brand perception. This, in turn, can lead to increased customer retention and recommendations.

2. Improved communication and diverse entertainment options within the system alleviate travel delay discomfort, potentially boosting customer retention and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

3. The edutainment system not only ensures passengers' thorough knowledge of flight safety, a critical aspect for any airline, but also elevates the overall flight experience. This can lead to higher customer satisfaction scores and increased customer loyalty.
